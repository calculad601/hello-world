Greetings!

I'm gersh601. My interests include javascript, python and game-development. Web-development is also interesting, but I hope to do more with HTML5 game creation. I should also mention that I'm not an expert with programming or game creation, yet my goal is to become more experienced as time goes on. You could label me as a hobbist...it keeps me busy and out of the bars.
